        "In answering the question [\"What Is Ethics\"](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/what-is-ethics/), The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics says that the term refers to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do\n",
        "- The study and development of one's ethical standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no list of right answers. There is no list of do and don't. Ethics is complicated, and context-dependent. It involves the perspectives of many stakeholders. Ethics is a muscle that you have to develop and practice. In this chapter, our goal is to provide some signposts to help you on that journey.\n",
        "\n",
        "Spotting ethical issues is best to do as part of a **collaborative team**. This is the only way you can really incorporate different perspectives. Different people's backgrounds will help them to see things which may not be obvious to you. Working with a team is helpful for many \"muscle-building\" activities, including this one."

        "The Verge investigated software used in over half of the US states to determine how much healthcare people receive, and documented their findings in the article [\"What Happens When an Algorithm Cuts Your Healthcare\"](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy). After implementation of the algorithm in Arkansas, hundreds of people (many with severe disabilities) had their healthcare drastically cut. For instance, Tammy Dobbs, a woman with cerebral palsy who needs an aid to help her to get out of bed, to go to the bathroom, to get food, and more, had her hours of help suddenly reduced by 20 hours a week. She couldn’t get any explanation for why her healthcare was cut. Eventually, a court case revealed that there were mistakes in the software implementation of the algorithm, negatively impacting people with diabetes or cerebral palsy. However, Dobbs and many other people reliant on these healthcare benefits live in fear that their benefits could again be cut suddenly and inexplicably."

        "In a complex system, it is easy for no one person to feel responsible for outcomes. While this is understandable, it does not lead to good results. In the earlier example of the Arkansas healthcare system in which a bug led to people with cerebral palsy losing access to needed care, the creator of the algorithm blamed government officials, and government officials blamed those who implemented the software. NYU professor [Danah Boyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTl0yyPqf3E) described this phenomenon: \"Bureaucracy has often been used to shift or evade responsibility... Today's algorithmic systems are extending bureaucracy.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "An additional reason why recourse is so necessary is because data often contains errors. Mechanisms for audits and error correction are crucial. A database of suspected gang members maintained by California law enforcement officials was found to be full of errors, including 42 babies who had been added to the database when they were less than 1 year old (28 of whom were marked as “admitting to being gang members”). In this case, there was no process in place for correcting mistakes or removing people once they’d been added. Another example is the US credit report system: in a large-scale study of credit reports by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2012, it was found that 26% of consumers had at least one mistake in their files, and 5% had errors that could be devastating. Yet, the process of getting such errors corrected is incredibly slow and opaque. When public radio reporter [Bobby Allyn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/09/08/how-the-careless-errors-of-credit-reporting-agencies-are-ruining-peoples-lives/) discovered that he was erroneously listed as having a firearms conviction, it took him \"more than a dozen phone calls, the handiwork of a county court clerk and six weeks to solve the problem.

        "Currently, less than 12% of AI researchers are women, according to [a study from Element AI](https://medium.com/element-ai-research-lab/estimating-the-gender-ratio-of-ai-researchers-around-the-world-81d2b8dbe9c3). The statistics are similarly dire when it comes to race and age. When everybody on a team has similar backgrounds, they are likely to have similar blindspots around ethical risks. The *Harvard Business Review* (HBR) has published a number of studies showing many benefits of diverse teams, including:\n",

        "Diversity can lead to problems being identified earlier, and a wider range of solutions being considered. For instance, Tracy Chou was an early engineer at Quora. She [wrote of her experiences](https://qz.com/1016900/tracy-chou-leading-silicon-valley-engineer-explains-why-every-tech-worker-needs-a-humanities-education/), describing how she advocated internally for adding a feature that would allow trolls and other bad actors to be blocked. Chou recounts, “I was eager to work on the feature because I personally felt antagonized and abused on the site (gender isn’t an unlikely reason as to why)... But if I hadn’t had that personal perspective, it’s possible that the Quora team wouldn’t have prioritized building a block button so early in its existence.” Harassment often drives people from marginalized groups off online platforms, so this functionality has been important for maintaining the health of Quora's community."
